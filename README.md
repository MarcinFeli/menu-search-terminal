## Documentation

### 1) Menu
The menu itself has no function, it is a made menu by design

### 2) Dynamic API search 

The search engine uses the https://dummyjson.com/products/search?q=XXX&limit=5&delay=1000
 
where XXX - entered product name in the inputa

So we can enter phrases such as "Samsung" or "iphone"

### 3) Terminal 

Imitation of the system terminal. To get the available commands, type `help`.
For command `double` we need to pass argument which is number we want to double.
example `double 2` give us `2*2=4`
